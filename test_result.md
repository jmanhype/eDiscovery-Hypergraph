# eDiscovery Agent MVP - Testing Results

## Original User Problem Statement
Build an eDiscovery Agent MVP using the Hypergraph Agents Umbrella framework for automated email analysis in legal and compliance use cases.

## Implementation Summary

### Architecture Implemented:
1. **Hypergraph Agents Umbrella Framework**: Successfully cloned and properly configured
2. **Multi-Agent System**: 
   - Elixir Phoenix API on localhost:4000 for orchestration and HTTP endpoints
   - Python LLM agents for AI processing via NATS messaging
   - NATS server on localhost:4222 for inter-agent communication

### Core Features Implemented:
1. **Email Ingestion**: API endpoint to accept email data in structured format
2. **AI Summarization**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo integration for email summaries
3. **Classification**: Automatic tagging for "Privileged" and "Significant Evidence"
4. **Entity Extraction**: Named entity recognition for knowledge graph building
5. **Multi-Agent Communication**: Elixir ↔ Python via NATS messaging

### Services Running:
- NATS Server: localhost:4222 (messaging bus) ✓
- Phoenix API: localhost:4000 (main application) ✓
- Python LLM Agent: Connected to NATS and OpenAI ✓

### API Endpoints:
- POST /ediscovery/process - Main email processing pipeline
- GET /ediscovery/health - Service health check
- GET /ediscovery/sample - Sample email format

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Instructions:
Test the following core functionality:
1. **Health Check**: GET /ediscovery/health should return service status
2. **Email Processing**: POST /ediscovery/process with email data should return analysis
3. **NATS Communication**: Verify Python agents respond to requests via NATS
4. **OpenAI Integration**: Confirm LLM calls work for summarization and classification
5. **Error Handling**: Test with malformed data to verify error responses

### Test Data:
Use the following sample email for testing:
```json
{
  "emails": [
    {
      "from": "alice@company.com",
      "to": ["bob@company.com"],
      "subject": "Confidential Legal Matter - Project X",
      "date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z", 
      "body": "Hi Bob,\n\nI wanted to discuss the confidential matters regarding Project X with our legal counsel. The attorney-client privileged documents need immediate review for the upcoming litigation.\n\nThis contains significant evidence for the case.\n\nBest regards,\nAlice"
    }
  ]
}
```

Expected results should include:
- Summary of email content
- Tags: privileged=true, significant_evidence=true  
- Entities: Alice, Bob, Project X, etc.

### Incorporate User Feedback
- Ready for backend testing with deep_testing_backend_v2
- All services properly installed and running
- No previous issues to address

### System Status
- Elixir/Phoenix: ✓ Running
- NATS Server: ✓ Running  
- Python LLM Agent: ✓ Running
- OpenAI Integration: ✓ Configured
- Multi-agent Communication: ✓ Established

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.
