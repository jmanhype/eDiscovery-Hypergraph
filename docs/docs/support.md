- Domain-specific terminology
- Document types

We recommend human review for critical decisions and provide confidence scores for all AI predictions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does document processing take?</strong></summary>

Processing times depend on several factors:

**Typical Processing Times**:
- Text extraction: 1-5 seconds per document
- Entity extraction: 2-10 seconds per document
- Privilege classification: 3-15 seconds per document
- Full AI analysis: 10-30 seconds per document

**Factors Affecting Speed**:
- Document size and complexity
- Selected processing operations
- Current system load
- Priority level (enterprise customers can request priority processing)

**Batch Processing**:
- 1,000 documents: ~15-30 minutes
- 10,000 documents: ~2-4 hours
- 100,000 documents: ~20-40 hours

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I customize the AI models?</strong></summary>

Yes, we offer several customization options:

**Fine-tuning**:
- Train models on your specific document types
- Customize entity recognition for your industry
- Adjust privilege detection for your jurisdiction

**Custom Workflows**:

**Example Custom Entity Training**:
```python
# Train custom entity recognizer
training_data = [
    {
        "text": "The ACME-2000 product violates patent US123456.",
        "entities": [
            {"start": 4, "end": 13, "label": "PRODUCT"},
            {"start": 36, "end": 44, "label": "PATENT_NUMBER"}
        ]
    }
]

model = client.ai.train_custom_ner(
    training_data=training_data,
    base_model="legal-ner-v2",
    entity_types=["PRODUCT", "PATENT_NUMBER"]
)
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors

**Problem**: "401 Unauthorized" errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check if the API key has expired
3. Ensure you're using the correct authentication header:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.ediscovery-hypergraph.com/v1/cases
   ```
4. For JWT auth, ensure the token hasn't expired

#### Upload Failures

**Problem**: Documents fail to upload

**Solutions**:
1. Check file size limits (default: 100MB per file)
2. Verify the file format is supported
3. Ensure you have sufficient storage quota
4. Check network connectivity and timeouts
5. For large files, use chunked upload:
   ```python
   client.documents.upload_large_file(
       file_path="large_document.pdf",
       chunk_size=5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5MB chunks
   )
   ```

#### Processing Errors

**Problem**: Documents stuck in "processing" status

**Solutions**:
1. Check the processing job status:
   ```python
   job = client.jobs.get(job_id)
   print(job.status, job.error)
   ```
2. Verify the document is not corrupted
3. Check if specific operations are failing
4. Review error logs in the dashboard
5. Retry with a simpler workflow

#### Search Performance

**Problem**: Searches are slow or timing out

**Solutions**:
1. Use more specific filters to reduce result set
2. Enable search result caching
3. Use pagination for large result sets
4. Consider using saved searches for complex queries
5. Optimize search queries:
   ```python
   # Instead of broad search
   results = client.search("contract")
   
   # Use specific search
   results = client.search(
       query="contract breach",
       filters={
           "date_range": {"start": "2023-01-01", "end": "2023-12-31"},
           "document_types": ["contract"],
           "case_ids": ["case_123"]
       },
       limit=50
   )
   ```

### Error Codes Reference

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `AUTH_001` | Invalid API key | Check your API key in settings |
| `AUTH_002` | Expired token | Refresh your authentication token |
| `DOC_001` | Unsupported file format | Convert to supported format |
| `DOC_002` | File too large | Use chunked upload or compress file |
| `PROC_001` | Processing timeout | Retry with smaller batch |
| `PROC_002` | AI service unavailable | Wait and retry, check status page |
| `SEARCH_001` | Query too complex | Simplify query or use filters |
| `RATE_001` | Rate limit exceeded | Implement backoff, upgrade plan |
| `STORAGE_001` | Storage quota exceeded | Delete old data or upgrade plan |

### Performance Optimization

#### Slow Dashboard Loading

1. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Del (Cmd+Shift+Del on Mac)
   - Clear cached images and files

2. **Reduce data displayed**:
   ```javascript
   // Limit initial data load
   const cases = await client.cases.list({
     limit: 20,
     sort: 'updated_at',
     order: 'desc'
   });
   ```

3. **Enable progressive loading**:
   ```javascript
   // Load data as needed
   const lazyLoader = client.documents.createLazyLoader({
     pageSize: 50,
     prefetch: true
   });
   ```

#### API Response Times

1. **Use field selection**:
   ```graphql
   query GetDocuments {
     documents(first: 20) {
       edges {
         node {
           id
           filename
           # Only request needed fields
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Implement caching**:
   ```python
   from functools import lru_cache
   
   @lru_cache(maxsize=100)
   def get_case_details(case_id):
       return client.cases.get(case_id)
   ```

3. **Batch operations**:
   ```python
   # Instead of individual requests
   for doc_id in document_ids:
       client.documents.get(doc_id)
   
   # Use batch endpoint
   documents = client.documents.get_batch(document_ids)
   ```

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **API Key Management**:
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use environment variables, never commit keys
   - Implement key vault for production

2. **Access Control**:
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Implement IP whitelisting for production
   - Enable 2FA for all user accounts

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data before upload
   - Use secure deletion for removed documents
   - Implement audit logging for all access

### Performance

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process documents in batches of 50-100
   - Use parallel processing for large volumes
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Implement TTL for cache entries
   - Use Redis for distributed caching

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Monitor API usage and limits
   - Implement request pooling
   - Use connection pooling for database

### Workflow Design

1. **Modular Workflows**:
   - Create reusable operator components
   - Version control workflow definitions
   - Test workflows in staging first

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Use dead letter queues for failed jobs
   - Set up alerting for critical failures

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Track workflow execution metrics
   - Monitor operator performance
   - Set up dashboards for key metrics
