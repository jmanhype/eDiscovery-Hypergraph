## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ediscovery-hypergraph.git

# Start with Docker
docker-compose up

# Access the platform
open http://localhost:3000
```

## Architecture Overview

The platform consists of three main components:

1. **Elixir/Phoenix Backend** - Handles workflow orchestration, agent communication, and distributed processing
2. **Python AI Service** - Manages OpenAI integration and document analysis
3. **React Frontend** - Provides an intuitive interface for document review and workflow management

## Use Cases

- **Litigation Support**: Quickly identify relevant documents and privileged communications
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure adherence to data retention and privacy regulations
- **Internal Investigations**: Efficiently review communications and documents for investigations
- **M&A Due Diligence**: Accelerate document review during mergers and acquisitions

## Why Hypergraph?

Traditional eDiscovery platforms struggle with complex relationships between documents, entities, and legal concepts. Our hypergraph architecture naturally represents these multi-dimensional relationships, enabling:

- More accurate privilege detection across document families
- Better entity relationship mapping
- Improved relevance scoring based on contextual connections
- Faster processing through intelligent work distribution
